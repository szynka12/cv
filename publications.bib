  abstract = {The porous-fluid interface encompasses a region bridging the flow inside a porous medium and a freeflowing fluid. In the context of volume-averaged simulations, it can be described by a set of gradually changing parameters defining the porous medium, mainly porosity and permeability. In this paper, both the permeability and the porous-induced drag force are evaluated a-priori, by explicitly filtering a set of Particle-Resolved Simulations (PRS) of the flow in the channel partially occupied by the porous medium. Different porous matrices are considered and the influence of the geometry and filtering parameters on the macroscopic quantities is studied. Especially, the focus is placed on the requirements for the kernel type and size to perform filtering accurately, and their impact on the distribution of permeability at the interface. The performance of the typically used models for the permeability is compared to the explicitly filtered results. Lastly, a new model for permeability and the drag force is introduced, taking into account the information about the filtering size and non-uniformity of the velocity field. The model greatly improves the prediction of velocity at the porous-fluid interface and serves as a proof of concept that a successful porous drag model should strive to include information about both parameters.},

  abstract = {For turbulent flows in porous media, it is often assumed that the irregularity of the matrix would not affect the macroscopic, double-averaged (in time and space), parameters of turbulence. Hence, to improve currently used modelling techniques, the ongoing efforts of the community are focused on performing high-fidelity, scale-resolving simulations of flows in regular, periodically repeating porous structures. This approach allows for minimizing still large computational cost, however, it assumes that results obtained from those geometries are generalizable to more disordered configurations. We investigate this assumption numerically using large-eddy simulation and analyse the influence of the irregularity of the porous structure on turbulent characteristics in a fully turbulent flow in a channel half-filled with porous medium. The flow statistics are examined and compared between four simulations, a reference channel with regular three-dimensional porous matrix consisting of an array of cubes and three similar geometries created from randomly perturbing the positions of the cubes, with increasing mean value of cube displacement. We study doubleaveraged flow properties, the distributions of double-averaged Reynolds stress tensor, including the anisotropy of macroscopic turbulence and the drag force induced by the flow in the porous region of the channel. The results confirm the idea that the averaged characteristics, including the anisotropy of the stress tensor and the drag force, are not greatly influenced by the moderate perturbation to the geometry of the porous matrix. Additionally, the macroscopic turbulence seems to exhibit a high degree of anisotropy in the porous region and the adjacent boundary layer, suggesting that second-order closure could be an adequate modelling choice for such flows.},

  abstract = {The present study focuses on the assessment of the performance of a finite volume method based, particle-resolved simulation approach to predict the flow through a model packed-bed consisting of 21 layers of spheres arranged in the body centered cubic packing. The unsteady flow developing in the freeboard is also considered. Two highly resolved large eddy simulation were preformed, for two Reynolds numbers, 300 and 500, based on the particle diameter, employing a polyhedral, boundary-conforming mesh. The geometry and the flow conditions are set to reproduce the flow conditions investigated in the experiment carried out by Velten and Z€ahringer [“Flow field characterisation of gaseous flow in a packed bed by particle image velocimetry,” Transp. Porous Media 150, 307 (2023)] using particle image velocimetry. The numerical results compare favorably with the measurements both inside and above the bed. The effect of differences arising between the physical and numerical configurations is thoroughly discussed alongside the impact of meshing strategy on the accuracy of the predictions.},

  abstract = {The flexible use of hydrogen in energy storage and conversion applications necessitates machines with many axial stages. The cost challenges of blade production for multi-stage machines can be alleviated by the use of the recent advancements in manufacturing technologies, such as additive manufacturing and milling. This study analyses the effects of the surface features introduced by the new manufacturing technologies, which are often neglected or simplified in numerical simulations. The investigation focuses on the aft-loaded blade profile, T106RUB, which has been modified to match the characteristics of the original T106 profile under low-speed conditions. Additionally, the blade surface has been modified to feature streamwise oriented riblets, thereby modelling the influence of the manufacturing process. The T106RUBprofile, previously studied both in experimental and simulated capacity, provides a strong reference for analysing the riblets’ effects. The investigation is carried out using highly-resolved Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using SharC in-house solver. Results are compared with a smooth T106RUBprofile, focusing on time-averaged quantities like wall shear stress and the overlaying 3D flow structures using the Q-Criterion. The results reveal the formation of counter-rotating elongated vortices influenced by rib structures and free stream turbulence. The ribs have a counteracting effect on the wall shear stress for the pressure and suction sides, which is more pronounced on the pressure side while the suction side remains largely unaffected.},
